### Original Data
This data is from experiments carried out on a group of 30 volunteers within the age bracket of 19-48 years.  The activities
were broken into six different categories (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). 
Each subject was wearing a Samsung Galaxy s II smartphone on their waist.  The signals were used to estimate variables
of the feature vector for each pattern.  [Here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
is the original data set.

### Variables from signals collected ('-XYZ' indicates a collection for each the x,y and z axis)

+ tBodyAcc-XYZ
+ tGravityAcc-XYZ
+ tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
+ tBodyGyro-XYZ
+ tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
+ tBodyAccMag
+ tGravityAccMag
+ tBodyAccJerkMag
+ tBodyGyroMag
+ tBodyGyroJerkMag
+ fBodyAcc-XYZ
+ fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
+ fBodyGyro-XYZ
+ fBodyAccMag
+ fBodyAccJerkMag
+ fBodyGyroMag
+ fBodyGyroJerkMag

### These are the set of variables that were estimated from these signals:

+ mean(): Mean value
+ std(): Standard deviation
+ mad(): Median absolute deviation 
+ max(): Largest value in array
+ min(): Smallest value in array
+ sma(): Signal magnitude area
+ energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
+ iqr(): Interquartile range 
+ entropy(): Signal entropy
+ arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
+ correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
+ maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
+ meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
+ skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
+ kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
+ bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
+ angle(): Angle between to vectors

These combined to create 561 variables in the original data set.
